    "To install additional packages inside your `sample_fs.tbz2`, you will need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract the Tarball**: First, extract the contents of the `sample_fs.tbz2` file.\n",
    "2. **Install the Packages**: Chroot into the extracted filesystem and install the necessary packages.\n",
    "3. **Repack the Filesystem**: After installing the packages, repack the filesystem into a tarball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed guide for each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Extract the Tarball\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create a directory to extract the tarball\n",
    "mkdir sample_fs\n",
    "tar -xvjf sample_fs.tbz2 -C sample_fs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install the Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to chroot into the extracted filesystem to install packages. Assuming you're working on a Linux system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Change root to the extracted filesystem\n",
    "sudo chroot sample_fs /bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# Update package lists\n",
    "apt-get update\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install the packages you need (example packages: vim, git)\n",
    "apt-get install vim git\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exit chroot environment\n",
    "exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Repack the Filesystem\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Navigate out of the extracted directory\n",
    "cd ..\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new tarball\n",
    "tar -cvjf sample_fs_new.tbz2 -C sample_fs .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should have a new tarball `sample_fs_new.tbz2` that includes the additional packages you installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network Access**: Ensure that your chroot environment has network access if you need to download packages from the internet.\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: If you need specific versions of packages or additional dependencies, make sure to handle them appropriately within the chroot environment.\n",
    "- **Disk Space**: Ensure you have enough disk space for both the extraction and repacking processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter any issues during these steps, please let me know, and I can help troubleshoot."
